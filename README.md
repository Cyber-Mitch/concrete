Concrete is a simple programming language specifically crafted for creating highly scalable systems that are reliable, efficient, and easy to maintain. Concrete is a programming language designed to integrate Rust's safety and speed with the concurrency model of Erlang/Elixir and Go while being a small, simple language like Zig. It achieves this while avoiding Rust's verbosity and Go's limited syntax and feature set.

## Design

### Features
- Safe. Linear type system (heavily inspired by Austral spec and design)
- Simplicity and readability. The grammar should be context free and small
- Programs are about transforming data into other forms of data. Code is about expressing algorithmsâ€”not the type system
- Minimal. There ought to be one way to write something
- Performant as C/C++ or Rust
- Striving for orthogonality
- C/Go-inspired, context-free grammar, syntax: if, for, function calls, modules, pattern matching
- Algebraic Data Types
- Typeclasses
- Type inference only within blocks, not in function signatures
- Explicit over implicit
- Pluggable concurrency runtime with a preemptive scheduler, green threads and copy only message passing
- Profiling and tracing are integral, first-class features. While code is read more often than it's written, it is executed even more frequently than it's read
- Capabilities
- Compile to MLIR, WASM and generate C code
- Easily embeddable
- REPL
- Implemented in Rust
- Cross compilation

### Anti-features
- No hidden memory allocation
- No garbage collection or destructors
- No hidden control flow or implicit function call
- No global state
- No exceptions
- No default runtime
- No preprocessor, no macros
- No type inference, type information flows in one direction
- No implicit type conversions
- No subtyping
- No reflection
- No function overloading (except through typeclasses, where it is bounded)
- No uninitialized variables
- No pre/post increment/decrement (x++ in C)
- No variable shadowing
- No Java-style @Annotations
- No undefined behavior

### Features to debate
- Integer type that overflows to bignum
- Missing decimal FP. Needed for financial math
- Zig's comptime
